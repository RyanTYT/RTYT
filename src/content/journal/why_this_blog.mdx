Many take to Instagram and LinkedIn to share their life and experiences but Instagram feels like looking at life through rose-tinted glasses for the most part and LinkedIn, a place to glaze one another and achievements that don't feel genuine or authentic. So, I decided to make this so I can post my own  thoughts and journeys here without seeing what the platforms want me to see.

<br/>
Also, of course, this fulfils my selfish desire to genuinely share my achievements/projects/interesting learnings with others without feeling like a sell-out or feeling inauthentic for doing so. So, feel free to look through some of my thoughts on some things I find interesting.
