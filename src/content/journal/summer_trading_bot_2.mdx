I spent a significant portion of summer reading through research papers. Some were really interesting while others were less so and even less so were papers that in my opinion, quite blatantly exploited certain issues related to this field of study - including selection bias, sampling bias and sometimes even measurement bias (which I feel is the most blatant and worst kind).

        <td className="px-3 py-3">Research seemed well thought out and there were many regressions done to extract potential new information at multiple junctures which gives confidence. https://www.quantitativo.com/p/the-unintended-consequences-of-rebalancing claims of maybe relatively uncorrelated returns to a mean-variance portfolio, which seems promising but the performance outside of the key high-variance periods definitely leaves a fair amount to be desired, especially when the recent drawback from the Trump announcements on tariffs also delivered a fair hit to the strategy - though this could likely point to the strategy performing better during periods where the switches regimes on a large timeframe (). The worse performance in 2025 also doesn't provide a favourable first impression.</td>

Uncertainty resolution seemed like a possible sufficient reason to understand the phenomenon but definitely feels a little sus/werid given only 4 data points each year, but statistical significance provides assurance. In particular, performance in recent time since release could be decayed due to public information release? although an adjusted strategy seems to perform well in recent years, there doesn't seem to be enough data to fully support the new hypothesis. </td>
