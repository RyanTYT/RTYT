# A sea of choices

I'm interested in computing, maths and finance - in particular, i always wanted to try automating trades fully. I succeeded with a small simple bot that placed market orders for a bunch of stocks earlier on but it wasn't a full-fledged system and not something I could rely on. So, of course, an intersection between the 3, BZA, was the choice I made to learn what I needed to know and I thought being exposed to the Business Degree would give me exposure and help me come up with some ideas. I had a deeper interest in computing than the other 2 subjects which is why I picked the degree offered by the School of Computing. Whether this was the right decision, we will never know but here are some of my thoughts.

# Computing, really?

So, yes, i studied quite a number of courses that encompass some form of coding and the majority of courses cover using machine learning or statistical tools to do things. The more important things I missed out on was Computer Architecture, OS and Networks but I do plan on studying those courses soon outside of my degrees. BUT, the "Business" in the degree name really doesn't help - As a redditor would say, if I had a nickle for every time somebody has gotten the wrong idea that I am studying a degree in Business or that most of my coursework involves Business stuff, I'd be a millionaire.

That is not to say that I should have picked CS in the first place because honestly, some of the higher level courses I have taken in BZA have been really interesting (Hidden Markov Models, Econometrics, ...). Although these courses seem isolated or impractical in some sense while I was studying them, over the summer while looking and reading research papers online (for some ideas for trading), these topics actually come up fairly often and I finally felt like I could apply some things I learnt because I was in the course that I was in.
