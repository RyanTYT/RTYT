# An Unexpected Pivot

In 2024, I spent the summer building a full-scale trading bot instead of doing an internship.

## Lessons Learned

- Systems matter more than signals.
- Code clarity *is* strategy clarity.
- Markets don’t reward randomness — neither should your design.

## Example

```ts
const backtest = runStrategy({
  entry: signalFn,
  capital: 100_000,
});
```
