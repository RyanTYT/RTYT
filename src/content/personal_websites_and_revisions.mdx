## 3 revisions so far

So far, I have revamped this website 2 times now. Hopefully, this is the last time. The first rendition of this page featured some fun react components that I made on my own - a sticky scrollable image for the landing page that was kinda fun and an infintely horizontally scrollable component that featured my academic work so far. I thought it was alright, but the colour scheme was so bad I never wanted to look twice at it. Furthermore, there wasn't much space for me to add things like personal opinions that are relatively unstructured on the page. The second edition of the page consisted of a single clean react timeline component that I created on my own since none of those I found online really fit the kind of timeline component that I wanted. The creation of the component took some inspiration from codepen and tinkering which was pretty interesting. However, again this page lacked personality nor additional sectionswhere I could showcase myself properly, largely also because I was afraid of really designing the page.

This latest edition of the page is designed largely with Claude and ChatGPT, with the themes of each and every component centralised in a theme.ts file to unify styling across the pages as well. The code for each component is cleaner than the previous edition also because I discovered Material UI and how to utilise it properly. So, concepts like component variations and styling were lifted from that experience to create this website. Although it's a little business-y in my honest opinion, the design definitely blows my past two websites out of the water!
